Repository for RealmDB related R&amp;D
This POC helps in finding out the time taken by RealmDB for processing huge data.

For instance, in a go, it inserts 10K data in realm.

On every app cycle, this inserts 30K data.

Time taken to query the changes is also recorded and printed in logs

For better understanding, please check logs.
